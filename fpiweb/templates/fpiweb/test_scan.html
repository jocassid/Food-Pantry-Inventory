<p>The purpose of this page is to simulate the stack of boxes that the user is
working with. &nbsp;Some of these boxes are in the system, some are not, some
don't have labels. &nbsp;QR codes will be displayed so you have something to
scan when testing with a cellphone or similar device.  This page is only
intended for use during development & testing</p>

<p>May want to have box details page redirect to either enter box or fill box
screens.</p>

    <a href="{% url 'fpiweb:index' %}">Index</a>
